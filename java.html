                        <p id = "histdesc"><strong>Creator:</strong>James Gosling.</p>
                        <p id = "histdesc"><strong>Released:</strong> 23 May 1995.</p>
                        <p id = "histdesc"><strong>From:</strong> Sun Microsystems.</p>
                        <p>The language was initially called Oak, named after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later, the project went by the name 'Green' and was ultimately renamed 'Java' due to trademark issues. The name 'Oak' was already in use by Oak Technologies in 1994. 'Java' was chosen as a reference to Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.</p>
