Although I have experience with simpler programming languages like Python, I had never worked with an intermediate language like this one before. I found that both languages share similar concepts; for example, the 'print' function in Python is equivalent to "std::cout>>" in C++. C++ is definitely more complex, but its concepts seem more flexible in their usage.</p>
